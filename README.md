# Library-Tracker

This is an android app I wanted to develop during the summer to learn how apps are made and also solve a problem I had in real life.

When I visit any bookshop and find a series which I believe I may already have books from, my biggest problem is remembering which    volumes of a series I already have. The idea behind this app was to be able to lookup any book using Google Books API.

## Problem
What eventually led me to focus on my website project and game was the lack of detailed information in Google Books API when looking up specific volumes of some series - mainly that the API sometimes had different results from the web service interface Books and searching a book series of 12 volumes only returned one result representing the series rather than a list of the 12 volumes.

## Room for Improvement
  * Searching already tracked books.
  * Fitting book viewing window to size of content - font and size to prevent text being cut off.
  * Allow viewing multiple pages of the search results if user wants to browse instead of searching more specifically.
