# Library-Tracker
<h1>Library Tracker App</h1>
<p>This is an android app I wanted to develop during the summer to learn how apps are made and also solve a problem I had personally:<br>
<br> When I visit any bookshop and find a series which I believe I may already have books from, my biggest problem is remembering which volumes of a series I already have. The idea behind this app was to be able to lookup any book using Google Books API</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>What eventually led me to focus on my website project and game was the lack of detailed information in Google Books API when looking up specific volumes of some series - mainly that the API sometimes had different results from the web service interface Books and searching a book series of 12 volumes only returned one result representing the series rather than a list of the 12 volumes.</p>

<h2>Room for Improvement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Searching already tracked books.</li>
<li>Fitting book viewing window to size of content - font and size to prevent text being cut off.</li>
<li>Allow viewing multiple pages of the search results if user wants to browse instead of searching more specifically.</li>
</ul>
